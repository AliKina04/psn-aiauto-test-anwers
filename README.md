Introduction
=============

Artificial Intelligence used for to simplify and shorten work time if we have a lot of data that we cannot possibly read one by one. 
in this case, how AI calculates how long the device was down referred to by csv data (in second). 
In this process too, my CVS files will be converted into xlsx format to make work easier. 

## Table

Here is an example table for device network data :

| Epoch Time    | Value       |
|---------------|------------ |
| 1704042000000 | 1           |
| 1704042026000 | 1           |
| 1704042035000 | 1           |
| 1704042037000 | 1           |
| 1704042059000 | 1           |
