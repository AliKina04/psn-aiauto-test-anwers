Introduction
=============

Artificial Intelligence used for to simplify and shorten work time if we have a lot of data that we cannot possibly read one by one. <br>
In this case, how AI calculates how long the device was down referred to by csv data (in second). <br>
In this process too, my CVS files will be converted into xlsx format to make work easier. <br>

Data Table
===========

This is some of the section data contained in the CVS file. There are 2 columns, namely Epoch Time and Value

| Epoch Time    | Value       |
|---------------|------------ |
| 1704042000000 | 1           |
| 1704042026000 | 1           |
| 1704042035000 | 1           |
| 1704042037000 | 1           |
| 1704042059000 | 1           |

NOTE : <br>
"1" used for the value that means device was down. <br>
"0" used for the value that means device was up. <br>
